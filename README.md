# hello-nim
This is my first programming using the Nim programming language. It prompts the user for a name and then, it removes the spaces as well as titling it with a custom `title()` function that returns a titled string. It uses the `strformat` and `stutils` modules to format the output and help capitalize the start of each line with the `title()` function.
Made with love by Nathan! Have fun!
